From the following text, generate a JSON event based on the Google Calendar's events API, assuming today's date is Sat Jan 14 2023 14:24:30 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time).
  If a location is provided, add a "location" entry.
  If there are multiple events, create an array of events.
  Under both "start" and "end" entries, set the IANA timezone based on the timezone previously provided using any viable city.
  Always assume that the text's time is based on the timezone given in today's date.
